## Red Wine Analysis Project by Alyssa Soderlund

This is my final project for Stats 515 at George Mason University. 
Wine is a complex product with many facets that contribute to taste and quality. Understanding the major factors that attribute most to the quality of a wine is an important business analysis issue. My project attempts to understand what attributes impact the quality of a wine and how one can predict a wine’s quality by performing exploratory data analysis, variable subset selection, and creating multiple classification models. 

### The Dataset
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)). 

This dataset, from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository, was collected between 2004-2007 (Cortez et al., 2009). It focuses specifically on the vinho verde red wine from Portugal. Each wine was assessed in a laboratory for 11 different physicochemical features. Then, a quality score from 1 to 10 was derived by measuring the median of a minimum of three blind sensory tests conducted by wine experts (Cortez et al., 2009). 

The attributes of this dataset are: 
- Alcohol percentage
- Volatile acidity 
- Citric acid
- Fixed acidity
- Residual sugar
- Density
- pH
- Free sulfur dioxide 
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Chlorides
- Sulphates
- Quality

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/asoderlund/WineAnalysis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
