## Red Wine Analysis Project by Alyssa Soderlund

This is my final project for Stats 515 at George Mason University. 
Wine is a complex product with many facets that contribute to taste and quality. Understanding the major factors that attribute most to the quality of a wine is an important business analysis issue. My project attempts to understand what attributes impact the quality of a wine and how one can predict a wine’s quality by performing exploratory data analysis, variable subset selection, and creating multiple classification models. 

### The Dataset
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/asoderlund/WineAnalysis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
