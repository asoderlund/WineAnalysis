# WineAnalysis
Analysis of red wine data from the UCI machine learning repository by Alyssa Soderlund.

This is my final project for Stats 515 at George Mason University with Dr. Ramezani. 
This project includes exploratory data analysis, variable selection, decision trees, random forest classification, 
logistic regression for classification, and clustering.
